Different Matlab scripts to work with ESP32:

Some matlab script to work with ESP32 mainly to analyze and correct data of ADC 12bit that is inaccurate (using among other the technique of Look up table LUT).
One may find also scripts to get data sent by the esp wifi server and other stuff.

The code is not commented yet, some scipts may not work anymore and the folder is still a mess but lot of scripts should be easily understood or get some informations/insights about wifi exchange of data between matlab and esp, or informations about the way to get an ADC more accurate to read voltage from esp analog GPIO. Somes scripts are used for interpolation, fitting, plotting data arriving from serial port etc...

Hope it helps.
